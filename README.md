# New-York-City-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

## Problem Statement
The main goal is to predict the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. The basic estimate can be found, based on just the distance between the two points. However, this will result in an RMSE of $5 - $8, depending on the model used. The main challenge is to reduce the current RMSE to around $3 by using improved Machine Learning Models. This improvement can be carried out through Hyperparameter Tuning.
